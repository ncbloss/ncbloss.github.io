In 2017, we will invite participants to create interactive rites, ritual processions, elaborate images, shrines, icons, temples, and visions. Our art theme in 2017 is Radical Ritual. This leads to an obvious question: Just what is so radical about ritual? The word radical occurs three times in the Ten Principles, and most people regard this as referring to a breaking of boundaries and a shedding of restrictions. But radical has a second meaning: It refers to all that is fixed and fundamental in human nature.This set the stage for the Temple Burn in 2016. This temple, choked with hundreds of remembrances of the dead, was being quietly readied for burning, when a series of unrehearsed actions occurred. The crowd, numbering in the thousands, had gathered around the burn perimeter, when suddenly a sound arose, a sort of treble yipping, like the keening of coyotes; it traveled twice around the circle in a wave. Then a second wave of sound arose, this time pitched in a more dulcet tone, and rippled round the Temple three full times before subsiding into silence.</p>

		<p class="description">Beyond the dogmas, creeds, and metaphysical ideas of religion, there is immediate experience. It is from this <span>primal</span> world that <em>living faith</em> arises. In 2017, we will invite participants to <strong>create interactive rites, ritual processions, elaborate images, shrines, icons, temples, and visions.</strong>The experience of spirit is identified with breath. The word inspiration has a pedigree that extends back to the middle of 16th century, deriving from the even more ancient Latin word inspirare, which means to breath into, to draw air into the lungs. In this sense, we encounter spirit constantly in daily life in the form of sighs and sobs, snorts and gasps, any involuntary intake or expiration of breath. We speak of high spirits, low sprits, and spirited actions. We also know that spirit is highly contagious — it can spread with lightning speed through great assemblies — and it is identified with states of exaltation, as when we feel we rise above ourselves. Very often an excess of this feeling can produce an upthrusting of the arms.</p>

In 2017, we will invite participants to <strong>create interactive rites, ritual processions, elaborate</strong> <em>images, shrines, icons, temples, and visions.</em>One example of this aspect of spirit is revealed by an occurrence at the Temple Burn in 2016. For nearly a year prior to this annual ritual, a very lively debate smoldered like a creeping fire on Burning Man’s discussion lists. The dispute involved community members who viewed this burn as taking place on hallowed ground, as at a wedding or a funeral. Many were particularly impressed by the profound periods of silence that had come to punctuate the ceremony. Their adversaries countered this by advancing the principle of Radical Self-Expression, contending that everyone has an individual right to express his or herself, which in extreme cases might include yelling profanities.</p>

		<p>Beyond the dogmas, creeds, and metaphysical ideas of religion, there is immediate experience. It is from this primal world that living faith arises. In 2017, we will invite participants to create interactive rites, ritual processions, elaborate images, shrines, icons, temples, and visions. Our theme will occupy the ambiguous ground that lies between reverence and ridicule, faith and belief, the absurd and the stunningly sublime. The human urge to make events, objects, actions, and personalities sacred is protean. It can fix on and inhabit anyone or anything. This year our art theme will release this spirit in the Black Rock Desert.</p>
